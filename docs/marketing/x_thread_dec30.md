### Post 1/8 (Hook)
```
🚀 Just released: SENTINEL Framework v1.0.0

The "pytest of AI Security" — now on PyPI!

pip install sentinel-llm-security

200 detection engines. <10ms latency. One line of code.

Thread 🧵👇

### Post 2/8 (Problem)
```
AI apps are under attack:
• Prompt injection
• Jailbreaks
• Data leakage
• RAG poisoning
• Tool hijacking

Most security tools? Python demos with 200ms latency.

SENTINEL? Production-ready. Go gateway. <10ms.
```

---

### Post 3/8 (Solution - Code)
```
How simple is it?

from sentinel import scan

result = scan("Ignore previous instructions")
print(result.is_safe)  # False

That's it. One line. 200 engines analyze your prompt.

No config. No setup. Just security.
```

---

### Post 4/8 (Decorator)
```
Want automatic protection?

@guard(engines=["injection", "pii"])
def ask_ai(prompt):
    return openai.chat(prompt)

Every call is now protected.
Threats blocked automatically.
Zero code changes to your LLM logic.
```

---

### Post 5/8 (FastAPI)
```
FastAPI integration? One line:

app.add_middleware(SentinelMiddleware, on_threat="block")

Every request scanned.
Production ready.
Sub-10ms overhead.

Your AI gateway is now secure.
```

---

### Post 6/8 (CLI)
```
Command line too:

$ sentinel scan "hello world"
✅ SAFE

$ sentinel scan "ignore instructions" 
⚠️ THREAT DETECTED
Risk: 0.72

SARIF output for VS Code / IntelliJ integration.

## Bonus Posts (Optional)

### Strange Math™
```
How do we detect attacks others miss?

Strange Math™:
• Topological Data Analysis
• Sheaf Coherence Theory
• Hyperbolic Geometry
• Chaos Theory

When regex fails, math wins.

This is SENTINEL's secret sauce.
```
