# Cover Letter — AI Security Engineer

---

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the AI Security Engineer position. As the **solo creator of SENTINEL**, a 105K+ LOC AI security platform with 212 detection engines, I bring hands-on experience building production-grade LLM protection systems from the ground up.

## Why I'm a Strong Fit

**Technical Depth:** I've implemented defenses for the full spectrum of AI threats—from classic prompt injection to cutting-edge attacks like GateBreaker (MoE exploitation), DECEPTICON (dark patterns), and agentic AI vulnerabilities. My platform covers OWASP LLM Top 10 and the emerging OWASP Agentic AI Top 10.

**Innovative Approach:** SENTINEL uses "Strange Math"—Topological Data Analysis and Sheaf Coherence Theory—to detect attacks that evade traditional pattern matching. This demonstrates my ability to apply advanced mathematics to practical security problems.

**Production Mindset:** I built Shield, a Pure C security DMZ achieving <1ms latency at 10K+ RPS. I understand the trade-offs between security depth and production performance.

**Research-Driven:** I maintain a daily R&D practice, tracking the latest papers from arXiv, HuggingFace, and security conferences. I've rapidly implemented defenses for threats discovered just days before.

## What I Offer

- Deep expertise in LLM attack vectors and defense mechanisms
- Ability to build security systems from scratch, solo
- Strong Python + C, with Rust on the roadmap
- Passion for making AI systems safer

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building SENTINEL can contribute to your team's AI security efforts.

Best regards,
