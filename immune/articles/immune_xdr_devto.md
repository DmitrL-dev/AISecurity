# IMMUNE: Open Source EDR/XDR/MDR — Progress Report

I'm building **SENTINEL IMMUNE** — an open source security platform in Pure C.

This is a solo project. Progress is steady, not fast. But I'm sharing what **actually works today**.

---

## What This Is

IMMUNE is a complete security stack:

- **EDR** (Endpoint Detection) — Kernel module on each host (6 syscall hooks)
- **XDR** (Extended Detection) — Cross-agent correlation in Hive (24 modules)
- **MDR** (Managed Detection) — Automated playbook responses

All open source. All Pure C. No Python dependencies.

---

## What Actually Works Right Now

### Kernel Module (v2.2) — ✅ Tested

Six syscall hooks that intercept at kernel level:

```
root@dragonfly:~# kldload ./immune.ko

IMMUNE: [BLOCKED] exec /tmp/test.sh (pid=3158)
IMMUNE: [BLOCKED] connect 127.0.0.1:4444 (pid=3159)
IMMUNE: [AUDIT] open /etc/master.passwd (pid=3160)
IMMUNE: [AUDIT] setuid 0->65534 (pid=3162)
```

**This is real output.** The module blocks suspicious executions and network connections, audits sensitive file access.

| Hook      | Status     | What It Does                            |
| --------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `execve`  | ✅ Working | Blocks /tmp/ and reverse shell patterns |
| `connect` | ✅ Working | Blocks connections to port 4444         |
| `bind`    | ✅ Working | Detects backdoor listeners              |
| `open`    | ✅ Working | Audits /etc/shadow, /etc/master.passwd  |
| `fork`    | ✅ Working | Tracks process creation                 |
| `setuid`  | ✅ Working | Detects privilege escalation            |

### Hive Server (v1.0) — ✅ Compiles & Runs

```bash
root@dragonfly:~/immune/hive# ./build.sh

=== SUCCESS ===
Binary: bin/hived
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  110208 Jan  3 15:24 bin/hived
```

24 modules compiled into 110KB binary:

- `sentinel.c` — Bridge to SENTINEL AI platform
- `correlate.c` — Cross-agent event correlation
- `playbook.c` — Automated response playbooks
- `network.c`, `api.c`, `crypto.c`, `jail.c`... 21 more

### Agent Daemon (v1.0) — ✅ Connects

```
SENTINEL IMMUNE Agent v1.0.0
DragonFlyBSD Edition
Hive: localhost:9998

IMMUNE Agent: kmod detected (enabled=1, events=3)
IMMUNE Agent: Connected to Hive at localhost:9998
```

Agent reads kernel events via sysctl and forwards to Hive.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│            HIVE (110KB)             │
│  Central orchestrator, 24 modules   │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │ TCP
┌─────────────────┴───────────────────┐
│         AGENT (userspace)           │
│     Reads sysctl, sends JSON        │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │ sysctl IPC
┌─────────────────┴───────────────────┐
│         KMOD (kernel)               │
│     6 syscall hooks, ring buffer    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

All components work together. Not 24 separate tools bolted together — **one organism**.

## Why DragonFlyBSD as the Hive OS

This isn't just "we made an agent for DragonFlyBSD". **The Hive itself runs on DragonFlyBSD.**

The central security command — the brain of the entire operation — is built for and runs on DragonFlyBSD. Here's why:

### HAMMER2 Filesystem
- **Instant forensic snapshots** — When a threat is detected, we can snapshot the entire system state in milliseconds
- **Copy-on-write** — Snapshots cost almost nothing, can keep hundreds
- **Tamper evidence** — Attackers can't easily hide their tracks

### Native Jails
- **Process isolation** without Docker/container overhead
- **Network-isolated quarantine** — Compromised processes can't phone home
- **Kernel-level enforcement** — Not userspace fakery

### Clean Kernel API
- **Simple syscall hooking** — No fighting with kernel complexity
- **LWKT tokens** — Deadlock-free locking primitives
- **No systemd** — Direct control, predictable behavior

### Minimal Attack Surface
- Smaller codebase than Linux
- Less widely targeted (security through obscurity as a bonus, not strategy)
- BSD license allows full customization

**The philosophy:** If the security command center itself can be compromised, everything downstream is worthless. So we put it on the most defensible OS we could find.

Is this the fastest development path? No.  
Is this the most secure? I believe so.

## Part of SENTINEL Ecosystem

IMMUNE isn't a standalone project. It's the **kernel-level foundation** of the SENTINEL AI Security Platform.

### How They Connect

| Component | Role | IMMUNE Integration |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| **BRAIN** | 207 ML/Rule engines | IMMUNE sends events → Brain analyzes → verdict returns |
| **SHIELD** | Request pre-filter | Shield blocks at API → IMMUNE blocks at kernel |
| **GATEWAY** | Production API | Gateway routes traffic → IMMUNE monitors hosts |
| **STRIKE** | Red team payloads | Strike tests → IMMUNE should detect and block |

### The Multiplier Effect

Each layer reinforces the others:

1. **SHIELD** blocks 80% of attacks at the API edge
2. **BRAIN** catches 15% more with ML analysis
3. **IMMUNE** stops the remaining 5% that made it to the host

**Result:** An attacker needs to bypass Pure C pre-filter, 207 detection engines, AND kernel syscall hooks. That's why we call it "defense in depth".

## What's NOT Ready Yet

Being honest about current limitations:

- ❌ TLS encryption for agent-hive communication (TCP only now)
- ❌ SENTINEL AI integration (bridge code exists, not connected)
- ❌ Linux/Windows agents (DragonFlyBSD only)
- ❌ Web dashboard
- ❌ Production hardening

---

## Why Open Source

This is fully open source because:

1. Security tools should be auditable
2. Solo dev = slow progress, community can help
3. I believe in building public infrastructure

The code is at [GitHub repo]. No paid tiers, no "enterprise features". Everything is open.

---

## Solo Dev Reality

I work on this alone. That means:

- Progress is steady, not rushed
- Some days I fix one bug, other days I add whole modules
- Quality over speed — I'd rather ship working code slowly

There's a [roadmap in the README](https://github.com/DmitrL-dev/AISecurity/tree/main/sentinel-community/immune#roadmap) with quarterly milestones. PRs welcome.

---

## Source Code

Code will be pushed to GitHub after this article goes live:

**Repository:** [github.com/DmitrL-dev/AISecurity](https://github.com/DmitrL-dev/AISecurity/tree/main/sentinel-community/immune)

The `immune/` directory contains:

- `hive/` — Central server (24 .c files)
- `agent/kmod/` — DragonFlyBSD kernel module
- `agent/src/` — Userspace daemon

Star the repo to get notified when the code lands.

## Numbers (Real)

| Metric              | Value  |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| C source files      | 30+    |
| Hive modules        | 24     |
| Hive binary         | 110KB  |
| Kmod hooks          | 6      |
| Python dependencies | 0      |
| Contributors        | 1 (me) |

---

## Follow Along

I post updates as I build. Next priorities:

1. TLS for agent communication
2. HAMMER2 forensic snapshots on detection
3. Connect SENTINEL AI bridge properly

Building security infrastructure the hard way. Slow but right.
